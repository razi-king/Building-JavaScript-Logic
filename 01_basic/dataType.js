"use strict";
// All Your JS Code Get Treated As A Newer Version Of Code
// We Use This As To Define Or Tell Our Compiler That We Are Goona Right The Newer JavaScript Code
/* As In Older JavaScript We Don't Have Class Arrow Function But Now We Have Them
   Also There Is No Way For To Write 
   "use no script" 
   And Now The Browser Or Compiler Know That We Are Most Goona Write New Code 
   But Writing "use strict" is a good way of writing the code Or Is Also Good Practice
